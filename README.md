## Overview

Einstein GPT for Developers is an AI powered developer tool that is available as an easy-to-install VS Code extension built using CodeGen, Salesforce‚Äôs secure, custom AI model. Our goal is to improve developer productivity through AI-based code generation. At this point of time, the Einstein GPT for Devs extension can:

- Generate code from natural language instructions within an existing Apex class, trigger, or anonymous Apex file. Simply enter in a prompt describing what you'd like to build and see Apex code generated within your editor.

<br>

At this time, the tool does not:
- Create new Apex classes and scaffolded methods without an existing file.
- Take into account any metadata (or context) from your local project or Salesforce org. Generated code is determined by your prompt only.
