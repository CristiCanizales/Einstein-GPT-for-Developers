## Overview

Use Einstein for Developers, an AI-powered developer tool to enhance developer productivity by quickly generating code suggestions using natural language instructions. Einstein for Developers is available as an easy-to-install VS Code extension built using CodeGen, Salesforce‚Äôs secure, custom AI model. The extension is available in the VS Code and Open VSX marketplaces. Use the extension in this release to generate boilerplate code from natural language instructions in a sidebar, so you can work with your editor and the tool side by side, without any interruptions to your workflow. You can also get code suggestions within an existing Apex class, trigger, or anonymous Apex file. Use the VS Code Command Palette to enter a prompt describing what you‚Äôd like to build and then generate code suggestions within your editor.
